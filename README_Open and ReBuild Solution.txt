Hello Professors,

DressWell-Boutique-Assignment4.zip contains another zip file for the project named: DressWell_MVC_DataDisplayGrid_Project.zip. Please unzip DressWell_MVC_DataDisplayGrid_Project and click on DressWellSolution.sln to open the solution in Visual Studio.

Please clean and Rebuild Solution before running it.
I have created a table on Customer Details Tab. On Clicking the Customer Details Tab, it will bring data from the backend and display it on the front end in a tabular format. 

Thanks,
Dipti Madane
